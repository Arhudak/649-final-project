                On July 1, 2021, the implementation of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) policies marked a historic shift in college athletics. These changes allowed student-athletes to monetize their personal brand for the first time, earning compensation through endorsements, sponsorships, and other avenues. NIL represents a major departure from traditional college sports norms, driven largely by the rise of social media and growing demands for transparency and fairness in athlete compensation. This investigation explores the wide-reaching impact of NIL on athletes, institutions, and the overall college sports ecosystem.

                Before July 2021, NCAA rules strictly prohibited student-athletes from profiting off their name, image, or likeness. The intent was to preserve amateurism and maintain a level playing field. However, this model faced increasing criticism and legal challenges, most notably in the O'Bannon v. NCAA case, which argued that college athletes should be compensated for the commercial use of their likeness, and the pivotal Alston decision, which challenged restrictions on education-related benefits. These legal pressures helped pave the way for NIL policy reform.

                With NIL now in effect, student-athletes have access to a growing array of earning opportunities. These include brand endorsements, paid appearances, social media sponsorships, and merchandise sales. The rise of NIL-focused collectives and athlete agents has further expanded deal-making potential, transforming the business side of college sports.

                NIL deals are agreements with third-party entities, which has led to “NIL collectives.” These NIL collectives are organizations that work to create these deals between the athlete and the university, while acting as an unaffiliated entity from the university itself. A recent example of this is the University of Michigan’s deal with Bryce Underwood for an estimated 12 million dollars. A deal made possible by an NIL collective, Champion Circle. The deal was funded by billionaire Larry Ellison and his wife Jolin, a Michigan alum.

                Furthermore, the proposed settlement from House vs. NCAA allows schools to begin directly sharing portions of their athletic department's revenue with athletes starting in the 2025 season, paving the way for schools to compensate athletes directly. In the realm of NIL, schools with higher revenue can offer more substantial financial incentives to their athletes, theoretically making the program more attractive to top recruits.

                The scatter plot above shows the relationship between a school’s recruitment rank for the upcoming 2025 season, which is based on how many top recruits they were able to get, and their football revenue share. According to the NCAA, they estimate that schools will share up to 22% of their athletic revenue with their athletes. Furthermore, the NCAA estimates that 77.3% of this revenue will be shared with the football team (NIL-NCAA, 2025).

                A breakdown of NIL earnings reveals notable disparities across sports, gender, and social media influence. High-profile male athletes, especially in football and basketball, typically secure the most lucrative deals. However, female athletes with strong social media followings have carved out profitable opportunities as well. These dynamics underscore inequalities in both market reach and institutional support.

                While this revenue share is a significant factor in the landscape of college athletics, the distribution of NIL deals adds another layer of complexity. NIL deal activity varies widely across states, schools, and athletic conferences. Larger programs and schools in major markets tend to secure more and larger deals, highlighting geographic and institutional inequalities. The legal environment also plays a role, with differing state-level NIL regulations affecting deal volume and scope.

                Before diving into the specific correlation between NIL funding and team performance, it’s important to consider the broader financial context of collegiate athletics. Team revenue—generated from ticket sales, broadcasting rights, merchandise, and other sources—often reflects an institution's overall financial resources, which can, in turn, influence its ability to secure NIL deals for athletes.

                A comparison between team revenue and NIL revenue gives insight into how schools are leveraging their financial advantages to boost athletic performance. Institutions with higher overall team revenue may have greater capacity to fund NIL deals, as seen through the positive correlation between the two, potentially providing athletes with more lucrative opportunities and enhancing the school's competitive standing.

                These disparities in NIL deal availability raise important questions about the implications of increased NIL funding. Does higher NIL funding directly impact team performance? A closer analysis of NIL funding estimates by school combined with performance data (win percentage), reveals a notable correlation between NIL funding and team success. This connection suggests that institutions with higher NIL earnings may gain a competitive advantage by attracting top-tier recruits who are motivated not only by athletic opportunities but also by the financial incentives that NIL deals provide.

                Additionally, when examining team performance, the margin of victory offers additional insights into how NIL funding may influence outcomes. Teams with higher NIL earnings tend to exhibit not only more frequent wins but also larger margins of victory, indicating that increased resources contribute to more dominant performances. This could be a reflection of both superior talent acquisition and the enhanced ability to develop and retain key players.

                As NIL deals continue to grow in importance, particularly for certain sports and athletes, their impact extends beyond just individual performance to influence broader aspects of collegiate athletics. The increasing demand for NIL deals has prompted the NCAA to propose changes in the allocation of athletic scholarships. Sports such as rowing and lacrosse, where NIL deals aren’t as common, are seeing proposed significant increases in athletic scholarships, such as raising the number for women’s rowing from 20 to 68.

                As NIL policies continue to evolve, ethical and equity-related questions take center stage. Concerns include unequal access to NIL opportunities, potential exploitation, and the growing role of third parties. Additionally, inconsistent regulations across states contribute to an uneven playing field. Looking ahead, experts predict continued growth in the NIL marketplace, with calls for more standardized policy frameworks.
